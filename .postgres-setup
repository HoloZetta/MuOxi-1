I am putting this here, because I always forget.

The offical Ubuntu guide can be a little confusing.

Here are the correct steps in order to set up a local postgresql database server.

sudo apt install postgresql
sudo service postgresql start
sudo su - postgres
createuser --superuser $USER where $USER is your username
psql
\password $USER is typed into the psql console to set up your account.
\q to exit
createdb $USER by convention
exit and now you can run psql in your own console with your username.
